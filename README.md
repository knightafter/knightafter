Hi there, I'm Ahad 👋 from Pakistan ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2fc9d31-0563-4a28-8654-f115ed00fa80)

I build Android Apps and always trying to solve the problems with the shape of App.

✔

-Kotlin

-Jetpack Compose

-Android Studio

❤ First lanugages that I have learned are HTML, CSS and C++.

Keep check my Android Apps and give me feedback how good they are and what need's to improve.
